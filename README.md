# typespeed_game
typespeed game using of course .... nothing ! purely vanilla like always 

## idea
the idea and the bet of the design came from this video of the wonderfull ossama elzero (typespeed game)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZcBHcmStJM&list=PLDoPjvoNmBAycCXz5d9WvqlmykUIys5e8]

## what i learned
well this time i learned a lot , this was one of the hardest project i've ever worked on . and for the first time ever i started carring about the quality of the code and applying the clean code concepts and DRY principle and stuff like that
